# When i open Html file in my local computer, it opens fine. When I  push it to Github and it is not displayed correctly. I got a lot of comments on prevous peer review excercise. However, I was not able to view the file during grading of some of the peers work. Please clone the repo to your local drive so that the html file can be viewed correctly.
I apologize for the inconvenience
