# When i open Html file in my local computer, it opens fine. When I  push it to Github and it is not displayed correctly. I got a lot of comments on prevous peer review excercise. However, I was not able to view the file during gradings of the peer. Here I have also attached a pdf copy. The name of the file is yuva.pdf
thank you
